- stack.cpp (cal) - use pointer and array to controll stack
- sizeof.c (cal) - print variable and struct size
- towerOfHanoi.c (Plan) - use simple recursion to implement tower of hanoi problem
- fac-with-dynamic-recur-tailcall.c (Plan) - implement factorial calculate in 3 algorithm
- toPostfix.cpp (Plan) - change infix to postfix using  STL stack
- toPrefix.cpp (Plan) - change infix to prefix using STL stack
- passBy.c (cal) - example pass data by value and pass by ref
